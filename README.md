## Motivation & Features
This project is a simple web app that helps you to keep track of how much water your drink. It uses SASS and bootstrap for the styling. It has all the basic features you'd expect with such an application out of the box - like filters and helpful tooltips. The purpose of this project is to gain an understanding of ASP .NET razor pages.
